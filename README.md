# Simplistic

A simple web server written in Dart. Supports TLS and a basic websocket 
connection. This is written only to be a tool used in troubleshooting
connectivity issues with the larger DGLux Server suite. 

This server is not intended for production use nor would it bring any value
as a stand-alone server.
